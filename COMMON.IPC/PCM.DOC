   little to be changed.  The biggest part that was a sprawling gargantuan
   was the menu system.  The Keyboard will use the Data transport system to
   send the keystrokes to the appropriate task.  The keyboard will also
   listen for who it is supposed to be sending the strokes to.
   The mouse can click on a window, which will select that window, and will
   also give the keyboard to that window.  so, while windows are up, they
   can just sit an listen for keystrokes.  all windows will listen, but
   because the keyboard is glued to whom it is talking to, nobody else will
   hear the keystrokes.
