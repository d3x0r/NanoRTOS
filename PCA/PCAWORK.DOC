This paper is to document the various messages that can appear in the
work window, why they could be there, and what they mean.

Message                                 Meaning
-------------                           --------------
Normal color (Green on Black)           This class of messsages track
                                        the progress of work through
                                        the system.

Ct:#### Ofs:#### Pg:## Ch:# w:#         Ct is the count to thransfer
                                        Ofs is the offset in the page
                                        Pg is the page number
                                        Ch is the channel number (0-3)
                                        w 1=write to mem 0=read from mem
                                        All of the above indicate the
                                        conditions to which the DMA will
                                        be initialized to for the next
                                        pending transfer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
####(####) wds mising                   The first number is the number
                                        of words left to transfer by the
                                        DMA, the second number is how
                                        many words the DMA had left to
                                        transfer plus how many additional
                                        pending words the Driver thought
                                        it needed to transfer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### #### (####,##)                     This will be preceeded by a message
                                        indicated that the node was not
                                        linked.  The first number is
                                        the return offset for the procedure,
                                        next is the address of the node that
                                        is in error.  the next two are the
                                        Node Address (MC address) and Rex
                                        of the node.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### @@@ Time:####                      This is the general format of the
                                        time stamp message.  the first number
                                        is the address of the current node
                                        being worked on.  @@@ is a three
                                        letter text message indicating what
                                        timing point the node is at, and
                                        the time is the number of milli-
                                        seconds that the node has been alive.

These are the Three letter time stamps
and what they indicate.

Odd                                     Work was just picked up by the Odd

SND                                     Data for a complete Read node with
                                        data is going to be transferred.

SFL                                     Send of data failed.

Evn                                     Work was just picked up by the Even
                                        channel handling thread.

ESI                                     Even channel external SI has been
                                        generated.

ACK                                     Sloughed work has been acknowledged
                                        by the modcomp.

-#### ## RC:## ##                       Node has been received by PCA to
                                        be sent to the modcomp.  The
                                        first number is the Node Address,
                                        followed by Rex.  RC:## indicates
                                        the Return Code, and the last number
                                        is the sub-channel the work is from.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dead Node.                              The node received by the PCA handler
                                        was terminated, and therefore was
                                        not queued to either channel handling
                                        thread.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Side:@ Dma:@                            Side is either E or O for even or
                                        Odd side. DMA is either Y or N for
                                        whether the mail to input has data
                                        accompanying it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*#### ## to:## ##                       These indicate that work was just
#### #### ####                          received from the modcomp.  A *
  -or-                                  indicates that data was also received
+#### ## to:## ##                       while a + indicates mail only.  The
#### #### ####                          first number after the indication of
                                        data is the Node's address, which is
                                        used repeatedly here, because it is
                                        a unique identifier.  The Rex is the
                                        next number, followed by the
                                        Transport and Sub-Channel number to
                                        send the work to.  The second line
                                        indicated Options, Byte count, and
                                        Extended options of the Node.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Term/                                   If a node has been terminated by the
Found/                                  modcomp, then these will indicate
Failed/                                 the status of trying to find the node
return                                  within the IPC.  Term starts it, and
                                        will either be followed by a Found
                                        or a Failed, indicating whether the
                                        node was found or not.  all of these
                                        will then be followed by return,
                                        because we are gonna return the mail
                                        to the MC.

Abnormal color (Black on Green)         This class of message is to indicate
