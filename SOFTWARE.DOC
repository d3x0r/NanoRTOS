Environment parameters that are numbers can be entered as decimal by
just entering the value, hexadecimal by entering a # in front of the
number, or CAN code by entering an @ before the number, the can digits
must also be uppercase in the case of alphabet. Parameter names are
non case sensative.

Examples:     Parameter1=10
              Parameter2=#300
              Parameter3=@CAN

Note: At this time there are no parameters known of that would make sense
      to be entered as CAN code.  The ability was provided early on and
      may at some date make sense to use.
